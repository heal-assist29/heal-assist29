               <p class="question"><strong>What is novel coronavirus?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    The novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold

               <p class="question"><strong>How can people help stop stigma related to COVID&#45;19?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19. Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by knowing the facts and sharing them with others in your community.

               <p class="question"><strong>What is the source of the virus?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.

               <p class="question"><strong>How does the virus spread?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

               <p class="question"><strong>Why are we seeing a rise in  cases?</strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    The number of cases of COVID-19 being reported in the United States is rising due to increased laboratory testing and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.

               <p class="question"><strong>Can someone who had COVID&#45;19 earlier spread it to others? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                    Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.

               <p class="question"><strong>Can someone get infected through food? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                   Based on information about this novel coronavirus thus far, it seems unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through food – additional investigation is needed.

               <p class="question"><strong>What is community spread? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                   Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

               <p class="question"><strong>Where can I get tested? </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                   The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.

               <p class="question"><strong>Can somebody show negative for coronavirus earlier and later be positive?  </strong></p>
                <p class="answer">
                   A negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person’s sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
